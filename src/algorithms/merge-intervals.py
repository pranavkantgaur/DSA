Example 1:

Input: intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlap, merge them into [1,6].

Example 2:

Input: intervals = [[1,4],[4,5]]
Output: [[1,5]]


Naive algorithm: TC-> , SC->
1. For each interval, get list of overlapping intervals:
   * Identify the merged interval
   * Replace all these intervals with the merged interval.
